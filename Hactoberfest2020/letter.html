  <ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>

        <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Dacult, we have a pretty open-minded research faculity - as long as the subjects fall somehwere in the realm of science and technilogy. You seem like an intelligent, decidated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to gace on our tea,. Saying that, of the ideas you subi=mitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
        <ol>
          <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
         <!-- <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sur>*</sur>C(86<sur>*</sur>F), when the audience size expontentially increases (effect of 3 X 10<sur>3</sur>increasing to 3 X 10<sur>4</sur>.)</li> -->
          <li><abbr title="html">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="CSS">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol><p>So please can your provide more information on each if these sujects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resocurces, amd anything else you think we'd need to know> Thanks.</p>
    <h3>Exotic dance mover</h3>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate wor, <strong>I</strong> <em>did</em> exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definations: 
    <dl>
      <dt>Polynesion chicken dance</dt>
      <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle  like chickens, to encourage  theif livestock to be "fruitfil".</dd>
   
    <dt>Icelandic brownnian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a mean of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together ina circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies aroung in imperceotible tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to day that he thought this dance inspired modern styled sich as Twerking.</dd>
    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An interesting exapme of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s belived to have discovered a new dance style charachterised by "robotic, stilted movementsm being practiced by inhabitants of Northen Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold."</dd>

    <p>Your sincerely,<br>
